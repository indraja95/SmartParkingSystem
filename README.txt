A smart parking system which displays information about the availability of the parking lots on a OLED screen. This information can also be viewed on a mobile application called “SmartParking” by the all the authorized users.

For this, I have created a small parking lot with 3 parking slots, 1 entry gate and 1 exit gate and an OLED display board to display the information. All this information is stored in a google firebase database. I have also developed a mobile application which retrieves information from the database and allows users to see the parking spaces before they arrive at the parking lot and choose the best one. When a car arrives at the entry gate, the system looks for the availability of the parking spaces. If there is an availability, the entry gate opens and allows the car to park. Once the car is parked, the database gets updated and the live information is displayed on the screen. But there are situations when the user is not aware of the mobile application or the situation when the parking lot gets filled by the time the car arrives the entry gate. In such situations, if there is no availability, the gate doesn’t open and the car looks for another parking lot where there is availability to park.
